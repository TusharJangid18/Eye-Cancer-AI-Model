🟥 AI Model Access
The trained AI model (AI.pth) is not included in this repository due to GitHub’s file size limitations.


🧠 About the AI Model
This repository contains a custom PyTorch implementation of a dual-purpose deep learning model that performs both semantic segmentation and image-level classification.

🧱 Built on the segmentation_models_pytorch library

🧠 Uses the SegFormer architecture with a ResNet-50 encoder

📊 Capable of both region-wise cancer detection and image-level diagnosis

🧬 Trained on annotated ocular cancer datasets

🎯 Optimized for early detection of eye cancer through pixel-level predictions
